Our goal is to give you uniquely and efficient experience to express yourself.

The plugin adds powerful Elementor widgets built specifically for WordPress professionals. Our Elementor widgets organized in four categories:

= WordPress Elements =

When you create a new post (or a page) on WordPress, you choose a title, write an excerpt, select a publish date, add an author, choose featured image, select several taxonomies and maybe you define some custom fields.

In the Elementor page builder you can't display and style those components. You need to repeat the process and manually add a title, write the excerpt and add images.

That's where Press Elements comes in handy. The plugin adds smart widgets that let you display those post components. Now you can drag a "Post Title" widget and style it your way. The widget will automatically insert the title used as the post title. Same applies for all the other post components.

= Dynamic Content =

Regular Elementor widgets save the data as hard-coded content in the database. To change something you need to open the page builder and manually change the element inside the builder. Updating post titles, excerpts, authors and other WordPress Element won't affect the builder.

Press Elements uses dynamic content architecture. It doesn't save the title and other element as hard-coded content. It generates them on-the-fly. Just like the WordPress theme system.

When you change post titles and other post elements from your WordPress dashboard (outside of Elementor), they will be automatically updated in the content area and in the page builder.

For example, you can bulk edit several posts from your sites dashboard to change the author, post that use "Post Author" widget will be automatically updates with the new data.

= Template Design =

When using page builders, you need to create all the page element for each page over and over again. Currently you can't design single page templates and apply the design on the post. When you use the template system you need to manually change titles and images for each post/page.

With Press Elements you can create custom designs with post elements and save them as template. When you apply the template on other posts, it will inherit the data from the new post. No more manual updates!

You don't need to hire developers to generate custom page templates - with Press Elements you can do it using a simple drag & drop interface! Now you can design different templates for different blog posts, pages and other Post Types. When creating new posts, load your predefined templates from your template library.

With Press Elements you can use Elementor widgets to display and design your post elements! Just like developers use theme-functions to generate themes. How cool is that?!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Press Elements compatible with any Theme? =

It sure is! Press Elements uses standard theme functions. The plugin will work on any WordPress theme!

= Is Press Elements compatible with Custom Post Types? =

Yes. It works on any post type as long as it supports the relevant post element.

= Can I use Press Elements to design archive pages? =

Currently the plugin displays post elements on "single" pages. But in the future, it will support "archive" page too.

= I am a theme developer, how can it help me? =

As a theme developer you probably use theme-functions in your work-flow. Press Elements turns those functions to widgets. Replacing code with a visual builder to reduce your development time.

= Can I optimize the source code for SEO? =

Yes you can! Each element has an "HTML Tag" field, which is used as a container tag. This way you can optimize your template design source code the way you want. You are no longer dependent on theme authors for Search Engine Optimization in your source code.

= Does the plugin has minimum requirements? =

**Minimum Requirements**

* WordPress version 4.7 or greater.
* Elementor version 1.7.0 or greater.
* PHP version 5.4 or greater.
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater.

**Recommended Requirements**

* The latest WordPress version.
* The latest Elementor version.
* PHP version 7.0 or greater.
* MySQL version 5.6 or greater.

= Where can I suggest new features? =

You can suggest new features on our [wp.org support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/press-elements).

= Can I customize the author data? =

Yes you can. The "Post Author" widgets allows you to display author first name, last name, username, user bio, user image and other user data.

= How do I use the custom field widgets? =

When using WordPress based custom fields, the data is saved as text based fields. With 3rd party plugins, each plugin saves the data in it's own format (text, array, object). It's impossible to provide solutions for each and every plugin data structure.

That's why Press Elements has two widgets to display custom fields. The "Post Custom Field" widget is used to display WordPress based custom fields, and the "Advanced Custom Fields" widget is used to display ACF custom fields.

Both widgets can display custom fields as "Text" or as "Images". Each display type reveals it's own advances options in the styling tab. You can also link the fields to URL stored in other custom fields.

For more advanced uses, please contact us in our [wp.org support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/press-elements). The plugin is developed based on user feedback.
